# get_price

get_price implements a function returning the lowest price to book a room for a given amount of time.

## Setup

get_price requires Ruby (version 2.6) to run

[Follow this link to set up Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

You should now fork the repo, and navigate inside the repo in your CLI. Once inside, uncomment the get_price method call, inputting whatever number you'd like (representing minutes) as the second argument. Run the following command to execute the programme:

```bash
ruby lib/get_price.rb
```

You should see the answer in your CLI.

## Testing

A number of unit tests have been written for this app. The tests can be found in the spec folder. In order to run these tests, run the following command:

```bash
rake
```
